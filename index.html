      On the streets of eighteenth-century Cairo, Nahri is a con woman of
      unsurpassed skill. She makes her living swindling Ottoman nobles, hoping
      to one day earn enough to change her fortunes. But when Nahri accidentally
      summons Dara, an equally sly, darkly mysterious djinn warrior, during one
      of her cons, she learns that even the cleverest of schemes can have deadly
      consequences. Forced to flee Cairo, Dara and Nahri journey together across
      hot, windswept sands teeming with creatures of fire and rivers where the
      mythical marid sleep, past ruins of once-magnificent human metropolises
      and mountains where the circling birds of prey are more than what they
      seem, to Daevabad, the legendary city of brass. It’s a city steeped in
      magic and fire, where blood can be as dangerous as any spell; a city where
      old resentments run deep and the royal court rules with a tenuous grip; a
      city to which Nahri is irrevocably bound—and where her very presence
      threatens to ignite a war that has been simmering for centuries.
